Rank Forest
This is a part of the forest where the humidity has caused the undergrowth to be covered in a thin layer of mildew. The overpowering odour fills your nostrils, prompting nausea. Looking southward, you can see a dotted red line on the ground, beyond which is a dense, swirling fog. Just in front of the line is a notice board. There is also a large tree here that looks climbable.
