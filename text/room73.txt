Room
You are in a strange room totally alien to the rest of the adventure. The walls and floor are covered in listing paper and a large fan blows cigarette ash onto the many computers and peripherals that inhabit this weird abode. As you enter the room, a bunch of bleary eyed, extremely tired looking programmers literally fall out of the door. One, looking particularly harrassed, hands you a listing and says "Fix this will you? - We're off to the pub to celebrate someone finishing this game..."
