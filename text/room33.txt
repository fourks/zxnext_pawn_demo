Rank Forest
You are in the dying forest; a damp, gloomy place worn by the ravages of time. The atmosphere is very humid causing the trees to be covered in moss and fungus. Looking east, you can see a path running along the edge of the forest. To the south, there is a dotted red line on the ground with dense, swirling fog beyond. Just in front of the line is a notice board.
