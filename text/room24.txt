Up The Tree
You find yourself a long way up the ancient tree. There are an abundance of twigs and branches that all seem to be brushing against your face. The branches extend even further above your head but you cannot climb any higher as there are no more footholds. Set into the west side of the tree trunk is a small wooden door.
