Cavern
You find yourself in a fascinating cavern where there are many weird and wonderful stalagmites and stalactites, whose constant dripping becomes irritating after a while. The floor of the cavern by the north wall has a deep fracture in it which leads down into a thick blanket of darkness, the only other exit being an opening in the west wall.
