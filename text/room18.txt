Inside The Hut
You are now inside a dingy old mud hut. A shaven-headed guru wearing an orange robe sits cross-legged in the centre of the floor with a cupboard behind him. Also, a small bowl, full of rice, is on the floor in front of the guru. As you enter, he stands, bows to you and sits again.
The guru notices your wristband and breaks out into uncontrollable laughter.
