Room Of Incarceration
This is the princess's room of incarceration. It is brightly lit as the sunlight filters through the translucent ice walls and through a window in the west wall opposite a large bed.
There is a four poster bed here. A princess is here. Overjoyed the princess says, "At last, someone to rescue me! I knew my father wouldn't give in to Kronos. Oh, how can I ever thank you?"
