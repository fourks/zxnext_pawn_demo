Lava River
This is a large cavern, the northern half of which is taken up by a lava river which runs east to west. A vertical shaft leads upwards and there is a passage to the west. Even though the cavern is quite high, it is still very hot in here and you vaguely recognise the smell of sulphur in the atmosphere.
