Palace Gardens
You are in the palace gardens where rose bushes and herbaceous borders are neatly arranged around a central fountain. Surrounding the gardens is a high wall through which there are two exits: east to the gatehouse and west to the stone bridge. Standing in the southwest corner of the gardens is a small toolshed.
There is a mat here.
