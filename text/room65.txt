Bank
You find yourself at the edge of a cliff. To the east, far below, a fast flowing river runs south along a ravine. Westward leads into a vast, grassy wilderness. Looking south, you can see a red dotted line on the floor beyond which is a dense, swirling fog. Just in front of the line is a notice board.
