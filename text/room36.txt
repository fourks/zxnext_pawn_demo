Low Ceiling Room
You find yourself in a low ceilinged room that has been hewn out of the earth by some ingenious gnomes. Passages lead off in every direction, but they have obviously been built for people much smaller than yourself. The only passages tall enough for you to enter are the ones in the east and west walls and up the spiral staircase.
