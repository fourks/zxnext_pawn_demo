High Ledge
You are now on a ledge roughly one third of the way up the side of the mountain. A rickety old rope bridge leads out northward across a deep ravine to another mountain - it doesn't look too safe! Hundreds of feet down, at the bottom of the ravine is a fast flowing river. The only other exit is east, into the mountain.
