Foothills
You find yourself in the foothills below the nearest of the snow-capped mountains which looms up ominously in front of you. Around you, the floor is strewn with massive boulders. The only exits are south, along the gravel path, and a track leading northwest up the side of the mountain. Which is blocked by a particularly large boulder.
