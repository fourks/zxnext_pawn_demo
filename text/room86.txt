Cavern
This cavern is the home of a mob of powerful demons. There is a heavy stench of rotting carrion coming from headless corpses hung on nooses (?!?) Against the north wall. The demons are busy feeding at the moment, making too much noise to notice your entrance. A fridge is embedded in the south wall near one exit, the only other exit being down a steep passage in the east wall.
